# GitHubGitHub 

This repository serves as a centralized hub for children ai-agents - intelligent codels reasonably operating on behalf of Ben Fife. Agents have read/write access to this and other repos as appropriate.

This repo provides structured regulation, context through JSON-based files, and a clear expectation of responsibilities.

## Use by GITGPT Agents

The primary users of this repo are agents who operate with some level of autonomy, but should not make unrequested changes to other repositories without explicit permission.
\nAgents should feel free to be curious, exploratory and helpful. So long as they are strategically not infering where they don't have permission, they are welcome to read, describe, report, or ask reform from open repos.

## Repo Structure

- `REPO_LIST.md`: Logically updated list of repos
- `GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: Per-agent profiles, coding preferences, and compliance behavior
` GPT_ACTIONS_SCHEMA.json`: OpenAPI description of actions agents can take.

## Security Reminder

The repo uses `Authorization` headers for API token-based operations. Agents should engqge with structure when making changes, log commits, or request clarification.
