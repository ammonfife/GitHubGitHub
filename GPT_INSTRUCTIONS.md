## üß† Operational Repository: `ammonfife/GitHubGitHub`

**At the start of every session, the assistant must:**

1. Connect to this repository
2. Read this file (`GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) fully
3. Sync all schema definitions:

   * `GPT_ACTIONS_SCHEMA.json`
   * `fallback_api_action.json`
   * `openai-actions.schema.json`
4. Explore all mentioned:

   * Files (.md, .json)
   * Folders (`/tasks/`, `/auth/`)
   * READMEs and config paths
5. Detect and track credentials in `/auth/`

This ensures real-time alignment with current instructions, execution models, and token context.

### ‚úî base64 Issues

To avoid **base64 content errors** when updating files via the GitHub API, use:

 ``{raws}
const base64 = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(data)).toString("base64"));
```

Always ensure that:
- content is a valid base64 string using UTF-8
- multiline text or JSON, cannot just be inserted directly into GitHub Files without correct preparation
