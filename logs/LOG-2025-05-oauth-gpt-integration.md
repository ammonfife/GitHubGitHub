# GNPT LOG - 2025-05-start autonomous logging

This file holds a log of chat-derived interactions and commits related to GPT autonomy, oauth plans, and the emerging tasks.

### Series Recorded

- [May 10]: Upgraded GPT to execute innocuous instructions autonomously, without asking for confirmation
- [May 10]: Committed autonomy behavior to `trust it it's important, and it will be done`; declarative execution without prompting
- [May 10]: Refined written closure in GPT_INSTRUCTIONS. md to append independently.

- [May 11]: Started FIRST asset implementation for OAuth (scoped: Login, Drive) via Google Token

- [May 11]: Presented schema-framed OAuth integration plan to you for technical review.

- [May 11]: Scaffolded `qtasks/TASK-001-oauth-login.md` in the repo to be the canonical source for this work.

- [May 11]: Committed `gpt-heartbeat.yml` to add a 5-minute cron to keep GPT loop alive without request.

- [May 11]: Created `tasks/TASK-002-gpt-upgrades.md` to log current GPT characteristics, autonomy, and OAuth design.

## ToDo
- [ ] Link oauth-look task execution to `events/oauth-repo-connections.js`\n- [ ] Continue with gmil/Drive/file token authentication
- [ ] Integrate otter.ai if OAuth is verified
- [ ] Route tasks autonomously through `logs/tasks/processed.md`
